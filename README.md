# Lets-Hang-OUt-hard-
I can be difficult to spend time with friends. They're busy working, traveling, dating, having families, etc. Everyone has different schedules and it's hard to find a common time to hang out.

This a program that asks the user for a list of start and end times that people are available. After the user types "done", the program should output the time window where everyone is available. If there is no time when everyone is available, the program should output a message saying so.

Start and end times should be entered in AM/PM format. For example "2:30 AM" or "9:00 PM". You can assume the start time is less than or equal to the end time.

Below is the sample output. Your program does not need to look the exact same.

        = user input

My program output:
>>> Enter a start time
 6:30 AM
>>> Enter an end time
 2:00 PM
>>> Enter a start time
 11:15 AM
>>> Enter an end time
 7:40 PM
>>> Enter a start time
 1:10 PM
>>> Enter an end time
 3:35 PM
>>> Enter a start time
 done
>>> You all should meet between 1:10 PM and 2:00 PM
